The Real-Time Digital Clock is a simple yet interactive web application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It displays the current time in a 12-hour format with AM/PM and updates automatically every second without needing to refresh the page. The HTML structure defines the clock display area, while CSS adds styling with a gradient background, borders, and shadows to give it a digital clock look. JavaScript handles the logic by fetching the systemâ€™s current time using the Date object, formatting it with hours, minutes, and seconds, and refreshing it in real time using the setInterval() function. This project is a practical example of how front-end technologies can work together to build real-time applications
