The internet is a vast network that connects millions of computers worldwide, allowing them to communicate and share information instantly. At its core, the internet uses a system of protocols, like the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and Internet Protocol (IP), which break down data into small packets and route them across different paths to reach their destination. When you access a website, your computer sends a request to a server, which responds by sending the requested data back in these packets. This data is then reassembled by your device to display the webpage. This entire process happens in fractions of a second, making it possible for users to access information, communicate, and interact with others globally in real time.
